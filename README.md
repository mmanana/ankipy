This notebook is dedicated to the collaborative creation of Anki decks using an Excel file.

Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. Create your own deck using the .xlsx file as a template. You can develop a large database of cards and specify which ones will be exported to a specific deck.

2. All filenames must be written in lowercase letters. The script will automatically convert filenames to lowercase when necessary.

3. After running the script, you will obtain a .csv file in the required format for Anki import.

This project is partially funded by the Universidad de Cantabria (Programa de Proyectos de Innovación Docente 2024).
