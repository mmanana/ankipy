# ankipy
Python library for creating and managing Anki decks


This notebook is devoted to the creation of decks in a collaborative way by means of an excel file.

Step by step procedure:

1. Create your own deck using the .xlsx file as template. It is possible to develop a large database of cards and define which ones will be exported to a specific deck.

2. All the filenames have to be written with small letters. The script will convert the filenames to small letters when neccesary.

3. After running the script you will get a .csv file with the required format to be imported by Anki.
